### About Data Analyzer

The reason that led me to write the code for this application is the enormous advantages that LLM models offer in making the job of a data analyst easier and less prone to errors.

### What it does

Generates a pdf report from a file that can be in csv, parquet or avro format. The report tries to explain the different types of data and the possible ways to manage or process them. This tool generates a pdf with different observations, code examples, precautions; to work with the data using the python pandas library.
